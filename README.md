# GapCooldown
A plugin for OPFaction and OPPrison Servers.

# What does it do?
Let me tell you. Basically when a player consumes an Enchanted Golden Apple(A.K.A Gapple), It will put that player on a cooldown for 1 minute. So he/she can't eat a gapple for 1 minute.

# To Do
- [ ] Add regular Golden apple
- [ ] Config for time consume
